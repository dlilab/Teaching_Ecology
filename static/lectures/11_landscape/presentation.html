## A **landscape** is a heterogeneous area consisting of distinct patches (_landscape elements_) organized into a mosaic-like pattern

## A **mosaic** is the patchwork of different types of land cover/elements (e.g., forests, bogs, meadows, lakes, streams, etc.)

# Landscape Ecology

- Is concerned with spatial patterns in the landscape and how they develop, with an emphasis on the role of disturbance

- Is a relatively new branch of ecology

- **Goal**: Predict the responses of different organisms to changes in landscape

# Importance of scale

.font150[
Landscape ecologists often grapple with issues associated with spatial scale

Two important aspect of spatial scale: **grain** and **extent**

Grain refers to the spatial resolution of a study or data set; e.g., are the data or samples obtained at a resolution of 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;?

# Importance of scale

Landscape ecologists often grapple with issues associated with spatial scale

Two important aspect of spatial scale: .blue[**grain**] and .blue[**extent**]

Grain refers to the spatial resolution of a study or data set; e.g., are the data or samples obtained at a resolution of 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;?

Extent refers to the size of the study area being considered; e.g., is the landscape small or large?

No fixed scale, either grain or extent, unambiguously identifies landscape ecology (a landscape ecological approach can also be applied to a very small area with fine resolution)

# Landscape Structure

## **Landscape structure**: the physical configuration of landscape elements, e.g., patch size distributions, patch dispersion, patch shapes, patch connectivity / isolation, etc.

---

# Patches in the Landscape

.font200[
- **Patches**: relatively homogenous community  types that differ from their surroundings in structure (e.g., size, shape) and in species composition
- Patches result from factors: geology, topography, soils, and climate, human activity
- The area, shape, and orientation of the landscape patches influence:
  + Habitat suitability
  + Wind flow
  + Dispersal of seeds
  + Movement of animals

## Some pathces are stable and permanent (inherent edges) while others are subject to successional changes over time (induced edges)

???

Inherent edges: Natural edges, caused by changes in soil, topography. E.g., eastern North America â€“ deciduous, coniferous edge

Induced edges: May occur where floods or fires have reversed succession. May occur where humans have created patchwork of tilled land interspersed with fence rows and wood lots

# Patches have edges

Strategy is based on conservation requirements of grizzly bears.

Secondary focus on bird &amp; fish species.

Priority areas: core wildlife habitat OR key corridors connecting core areas

# Yellowstone 2 Yukon

.pull-left[
.font150[
Does Y2Y want the entire region to become a protected area or park?

No. Y2Y's vision is that the Y2Y region will be managed so that this world-renowned mountain ecosystem and its inhabitants (wild &amp; human) remain healthy and connected for centuries to come. 

This requires that wild animals are able to travel safely through land adjacent to and between parks.
