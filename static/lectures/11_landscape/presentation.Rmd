## A **landscape** is a heterogeneous area consisting of distinct patches (_landscape elements_) organized into a mosaic-like pattern

## A **mosaic** is the patchwork of different types of land cover/elements (e.g., forests, bogs, meadows, lakes, streams, etc.)

# Landscape Ecology

## .blue[The study of the causes & consequences of landscape-level (i.e., intermediate- to large-scale) ecological patterns]

.font200[
- The causes behind the formation of *patches* and *boundaries*, and 
- The ecological consequences of these spatial patterns on the landscape

# Landscape Ecology

.font200[
- Is concerned with spatial patterns in the landscape and how they develop, with an emphasis on the role of disturbance

- Is a relatively new branch of ecology

- **Goal**: Predict the responses of different organisms to changes in landscape

# Landscape Structure

## **Landscape structure**: the physical configuration of landscape elements, e.g., patch size distributions, patch dispersion, patch shapes, patch connectivity / isolation, etc.

---

# Patches in the Landscape

.font200[
- **Patches**: relatively homogenous community  types that differ from their surroundings in structure (e.g., size, shape) and in species composition
- Patches result from factors: geology, topography, soils, and climate, human activity
- The area, shape, and orientation of the landscape patches influence:
  + Habitat suitability
  + Wind flow
  + Dispersal of seeds
  + Movement of animals

## Some pathces are stable and permanent (inherent edges) while others are subject to successional changes over time (induced edges)

???

Inherent edges: Natural edges, caused by changes in soil, topography. E.g., eastern North America â€“ deciduous, coniferous edge

Induced edges: May occur where floods or fires have reversed succession. May occur where humans have created patchwork of tilled land interspersed with fence rows and wood lots

---

# Patches have edges

## The height, width, and porosity of borders influence the gradients of wind flow, moisture, temperature, and solar radiation between adjoining patches

## Some species can only inhabit the interior or core, and some are specifically attracted to the edge

## **Edge species** are restricted exclusively to the edge environment  (e.g. Indigo bunting)

## The edge effect can also create problems: attracts more predator; restricts dispersal, etc.

.font150[The shape of a habitat reserve matters!  As patches become SMALLER, they become LARGELY EDGE, losing the characteristics of the interior community,	e.g., Brown-headed cowbird]
