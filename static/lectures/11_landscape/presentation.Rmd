# Landscape


## A **mosaic** is the patchwork of different types of land cover/elements (e.g., forests, bogs, meadows, lakes, streams, etc.)

## **Patches** of habitat form the landscape

# Landscape Ecology

## .blue[The study of the causes & consequences of landscape-level (i.e., intermediate- to large-scale) ecological patterns]

.font200[
- The causes behind the formation of *patches* and *boundaries*, and 
- The ecological consequences of these spatial patterns on the landscape

# Landscape Ecology

.font200[
- Is concerned with spatial patterns in the landscape and how they develop, with an emphasis on the role of disturbance

- Is a relatively new branch of ecology

- **Goal**: Predict the responses of different organisms to changes in landscape

# Patches in the Landscape

.font200[
- **Patches**: relatively homogenous community  types that differ from their surroundings in structure (e.g., size, shape) and in species composition

- Patches result from factors: geology, topography, soils, and climate, human activity

- **Landscape structure**: the physical configuration of landscape elements, e.g., patch size distributions, patch dispersion, patch shapes,
patch connectivity / isolation, etc.
