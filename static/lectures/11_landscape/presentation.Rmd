## A **landscape** is a heterogeneous area consisting of distinct patches (_landscape elements_) organized into a mosaic-like pattern

## A **mosaic** is the patchwork of different types of land cover/elements (e.g., forests, bogs, meadows, lakes, streams, etc.)

- The ecological consequences of these spatial patterns on the landscape

# Landscape Ecology

.font200[
- Is concerned with spatial patterns in the landscape and how they develop, with an emphasis on the role of disturbance

- Is a relatively new branch of ecology

- **Goal**: Predict the responses of different organisms to changes in landscape

# Importance of scale

.font150[
Landscape ecologists often grapple with issues associated with spatial scale

Two important aspect of spatial scale: **grain** and **extent**

Grain refers to the spatial resolution of a study or data set; e.g., are the data or samples obtained at a resolution of 1 m<sup>2</sup>, 100 m<sup>2</sup> or 1 km<sup>2</sup>?

.font150[
Landscape ecologists often grapple with issues associated with spatial scale

Two important aspect of spatial scale: .blue[**grain**] and .blue[**extent**]

Grain refers to the spatial resolution of a study or data set; e.g., are the data or samples obtained at a resolution of 1 m<sup>2</sup>, 100 m<sup>2</sup> or 1 km<sup>2</sup>?

No fixed scale, either grain or extent, unambiguously identifies landscape ecology (a landscape ecological approach can also be applied to a very small area with fine resolution)

# Landscape Structure

## **Landscape structure**: the physical configuration of landscape elements, e.g., patch size distributions, patch dispersion, patch shapes, patch connectivity / isolation, etc.

---

# Patches in the Landscape

.font200[
- **Patches**: relatively homogenous community  types that differ from their surroundings in structure (e.g., size, shape) and in species composition
- Patches result from factors: geology, topography, soils, and climate, human activity
- The area, shape, and orientation of the landscape patches influence:
  + Habitat suitability
  + Wind flow
  + Dispersal of seeds
  + Movement of animals

## Some pathces are stable and permanent (inherent edges) while others are subject to successional changes over time (induced edges)

???

Inherent edges: Natural edges, caused by changes in soil, topography. E.g., eastern North America â€“ deciduous, coniferous edge

Induced edges: May occur where floods or fires have reversed succession. May occur where humans have created patchwork of tilled land interspersed with fence rows and wood lots

# Patches have edges

## The height, width, and porosity of borders influence the gradients of wind flow, moisture, temperature, and solar radiation between adjoining patches

Strategy is based on conservation requirements of grizzly bears.

Secondary focus on bird & fish species.

Priority areas: core wildlife habitat OR key corridors connecting core areas

# Yellowstone 2 Yukon

.pull-left[
.font150[
Does Y2Y want the entire region to become a protected area or park?

No. Y2Y's vision is that the Y2Y region will be managed so that this world-renowned mountain ecosystem and its inhabitants (wild & human) remain healthy and connected for centuries to come. 

This requires that wild animals are able to travel safely through land adjacent to and between parks.
