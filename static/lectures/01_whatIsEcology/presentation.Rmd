# What is ecology? 

## The study of .blue[interactions] among biological organisms and between organisms and their .red[environment].

# What ecology isn't

---

# Environmental Science

### Interdisciplinary field that draws concepts, expertise, and tools from natural and social sciences

### Ecology is a Component of Environmental Science

# Environmentalism

### A political and social ideology seeking to limit human impact on the environment 

### Ecology Can Inform Environmentalism


---

# Biomedicine

###  Gets conflated with ideas of "mainstream medicine"

### Generally applies to clinical practice and only to human populations (can some part of the environment make me better?)

---

# Natural history

### Descriptive study of natural organisms 

### Slightly separate from ecology, though ecological studies often utilize museum collections, and museum collections are essentially natural history storehouses

---

# Evolution

### Change of allele frequencies over time

### Strong feedbacks with ecological processes

# levels of biological organization

---

# Individual 

## A single individual of a species. Unit of natural selection 

### e.g., a single trout in lake superior 

### domain of physiological and behaviour ecology; e.g., how do zebras regulate their internal water balance?


---

# Population

## A collection of individuals that occupy a given geographic area and interact with one another. Unit of evolution

### e.g., trout in lake superior

### population structure, growth, distribution and abundance? How these processes are affected by biotic (e.g., .blue[predator]) and abiotic aspects of the environment?

---

# Community 

## A set of interacting species that occupy a given geographic area.

### e.g., fish communities in lake superior, focus on kinds and diversity of organisms

### What factors influence the number of fishes living together in a lake? How multiple species be able to coexist in a small forest?

---

# Ecosystem

## The set of interacting species (the community) and the interactions between these species and their physical environment. 

#### e.g., a grassland, focus on ecological processes such as energy flow or nutrient cycle

### How does fire affect nutrient availability in grassland ecosystems?

---

# Biosphere

## The global environment, consisting of all living things on the planet.

### e.g., the planet

### What role does concentration of atmoospheric CO2 play in the regulation of global temperature?

# Human activities have altered over 75% of the Earth's land surface. What is the role of the environment and land use change to each level?
