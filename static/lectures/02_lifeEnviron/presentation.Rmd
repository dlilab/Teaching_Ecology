# Biomes

#### Large-scale biological communities sharing _similar_ **plant** growth forms; often owing to convergent adaptations to similar physical environments; determined largely by temperature and rainfall (climate)

.center[![:scale 90%](figs/biomes.png)]

???

how does a particular environment result in similar plants? selective pressure lead to similar functional traits through evolution

why defined by plants? plants form the foundation of life on earth; they are primary producers

# Ecoregions (867 distinct ones)

???

how many biomes depends on who do you ask; or how different to go

# Major Determinants of Global Climate

### 1. Spherical shape of the earth: uneven heating

???

while the global distribution of biomes is determined by climate, what determines the distributions of climate?
