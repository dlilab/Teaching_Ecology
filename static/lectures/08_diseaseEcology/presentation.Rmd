# Parasite, pathogen, infection, and disease

.font200[.red[parasite]: an organism that lives in or on another organism (.green[host]) and causes .blue[harmful] effects (sometimes suffering, even excruciating misery, but not _immediately_ causing death) as it consumes resources from the host.]   .font150[(consumer-resource)]

--

.font200[When parasites colonize a host, that host is said to harbor an .red[infection]]

--

.font200[Only if that infection gives rise to symptoms that are clearly harmful to the host should the host be said to have a .red[disease], e.g., COVID-19]

--

.font200[.red[Pathogen]: any parasite that causes a disease (i.e. is ‘pathogenic’), e.g., SARS-CoV-2]


???

though infection by a pathogen does not always result in an infectious disease; asymptomatic

# Parasites are diverse

### Pretty much every organism of living thing has one or more parasite, including parasites (_hyperparasite_)

--

### Many parasites are host-specified or at least have a limited range of hosts (_specialists_); few has a broad range of hosts (_generalists_)

--

### The conclusion seems _unavoidable_ that .red[more than 50%] of the species on the earth, and many more than 50% of individuals, are parasites


---

# Effects of parasites

### Large toll on people: >25% human deaths are caused by infectious disease; 100 million people died in 1918 (the Great Influenza Pandemic caused by H1N1 virus); >2 million deaths caused by COVID-19 so far

### On wildlife: bird flu; chytrid fugus caused extinctions of amphibian species; white-nose syndrome for bats

### On plants: crops (e.g., wheat rust), trees (e.g., chestnut blight, dutch elm disease)

???

american chestnut trees used to be >50% of trees in temperate forests; now they are rare since the introduce of chestnut blight around 1900 from Asian

  + .blue[macroparasites]: larger, live on or within a host (in cavities such as the gut or inter-cellular), do not reproduce in their host (e.g., helminth worms in an intestine, some types of fungi, bacteria and protozoa)

# Evolution of host-parasite systems

### Natural selection has favored the evolution of .red[parasite offenses] and .blue[host defenses] 

### Parasite should optimize the trade-off between virulence and transmissibility (Ebola – highly virulent but not highly transmissable)


![](figs/virulence.png)

???

First, increasing within-host parasite replication increases virulence (A); second, increasing within-host parasite replication increases the number of parasite transmission events over the duration of the infection (B), until a point where increasing parasite replication reduces the infectious period (e.g., by killing the host and preventing transmission) (C); and third, increasing parasite virulence increases parasite transmission (D) until high virulence shortens the infectious period, thereby reducing transmission (E) 


---

# Evolution of host-parasite systems

### Natural selection has favored the evolution of .red[parasite offenses] and .blue[host defenses] 

### Parasite should optimize the trade-off between virulence and transmissibility

### Hosts also evolve, but typically slower than parasites, producing arms races between hosts and parasites

### The .red[Red Queen Hypothesis] predicts a continuing evolutionary battle between parasites and hosts, not a stable equilibrium

???

In 1859 European rabbits were introduced to Australia, exponential growth of rabbits

In 1950, the government released a virus known as _Myxoma_ to control rabbits. It kills an infected rabbit in 48 hours, with 99.8% killing rates.

Second breakout: 90%; third breakout: 40-60%; ... 6th breakout: 20%

rabbit populations rebound, virus persist
