# Predation (in broad ecological terms)

.font200[
Any interaction between two species in which one is benefited and the other is harmed.

Density of one species changes the .blue[***per capita***] population growth rate of the other

Species A (_resource_) --- **.green[+]** ---> Species B (_consumer_)

Species A (_resource_) <--- **.red[-]** --- Species B (_consumer_)
] 

???

It is per captia, not necessary the population size. For example, if it is a good year with mild winter, then rabbits survival will be high, leading to a high population growth rate and the abundance of rabbits will be high by the end of summer. Foxes will take advantage of this and kill more rabbits than normal. Even though the population size of rabbits increased, the per capita population growth rate will be lower than those without foxes.

$aR$ is the .red[functional response] of the predator (rate of prey capture as a function of prey abundance); in this case linear, i.e., prey capture increases at a constant rate as prey density increases

$caC$ reflects the numerical response of the predator population – the per capita growth rate of the predator pop. as a function of the prey pop.

The consumer and resource oscillate together through time, with the consumer lagged forward in time relative to the resource dynamics.
]

???

Since the model assumes exponential growth of the prey population in the absence of predators, the model assumes that there is no intraspecific competition or other factors that operate in a density-dependent manner when predators are absent.
