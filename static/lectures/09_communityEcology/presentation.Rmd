Even though I have separate sections on Competition and Predation in the course, I don't have one on Mutualism. Mutualism is important ecologically, but often each mutualism is important for a different reason. Mutualisms are often very specific for the types of organisms that are involved. .cyan[Because mutualism is caused by co-evolution, a lot of them have their own idiosyncrasies that don't generalize easily to a way of explaining the overall things that are common to mutualisms]. This is a contrast to Competition and Predation where there are a lot of features common to the interactions between very different pairs of species.

# What is an ecological community?

Community – collection of species that occur at the same place & time, circumscribed by natural (e.g., serpentine soil), arbitrary, or artificial (e.g., 1-m2 quadrat) boundaries

???

An ecological community is a set of interacting species which utilize the same environment.

# Calculating Biodiversity

### There are multiple ways to calculate biodiversity:

.font200[
- Species diversity
- Genetic diversity
- Ecosystem diversity
]

# Species diversity

.font200[alpha, beta, and gamma diversity]

![:scale 88%](figs/alpha_beta.png)

# Measuring alpha species diversity

.font150[One of the most common measurement is .blue[species richness], the number of species in a community]

.font150[.red[What is the species richness for both communities?]]

# Species Richness

.font200[
Impossible to count all species

.red[Need to estimate based on sampling (quadrats, plots, transects, traps, etc.)]

Richness depends on number of samples	collected

Use extrapolation to predict richness

- Want to predict the asymptote
- Try to collect as few samples as possible
]

???

- with a few samples, you collect mostly common species
- with more samples, you start to collect some of the rarer species
- only with intensive sampling do you start to collect all species
- unless you’ve sampled enough to reach this plateau, beyond which no new species are added, you will miss species
- biological inventories conducted by Nature Conservancy and others rely on extrapolation
- try to predict the asymptote. Also try to collect as few samples as possible to achieve that asymptote

+  well-mixed community (spatial distribution of each species is random)

+  individuals are sampled at random (brighter colored individuals aren't sampled more often than others)

+ sampling with identical methods (if used to compare two communities)

# Approximation

.font200[

$$E(S_{m}) \approx S - \sum_{i=1}^{S}(1-p_{i})^{m}$$

where $S$ is the number of species, $m$ is the total number of individuals in the sample, and $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$ in the original sample.

.font200[Community composition describes the **diversity and identity** of species within a given community

.blue[_keystone species_] is a species that has a large impact on community structure relative to it's abundance / biomass in the community (e.g., top predator)

.blue[_foundation species_] is a species that can play a substantial role in determining what species can exist within the community (e.g., beavers, earthworms). Usually, this is a species that defines much of the structure of a community through e.g., habitat-forming

# Succession, Disturbance & Stress

.font150[
**Succession** – directional change in community composition at a site (as opposed to simple fluctuations), initiated by natural or anthropogenic disturbance, stress, or the creation of a new site

Some biologists restrict the definition to directional replacement of species after disturbance

**Disturbance** – a discrete event that damages or kills residents on a site (and potentially creates opportunities for other individuals to grow or reproduce); either catastrophic or non-catastrophic (Platt & Connell 2003 Ecological Monographs)

**Stress** – factor that reduces growth, reproduction, or survival of individuals (and potentially creates opportunities for other individuals)
