Even though I have separate sections on Competition and Predation in the course, I don't have one on Mutualism. Mutualism is important ecologically, but often each mutualism is important for a different reason. Mutualisms are often very specific for the types of organisms that are involved. .cyan[Because mutualism is caused by co-evolution, a lot of them have their own idiosyncrasies that don't generalize easily to a way of explaining the overall things that are common to mutualisms]. This is a contrast to Competition and Predation where there are a lot of features common to the interactions between very different pairs of species.

# What is an ecological community?

Community – collection of species that occur at the same place & time, circumscribed by natural (e.g., serpentine soil), arbitrary, or artificial (e.g., 1-m2 quadrat) boundaries


![:scale 85%](figs/community.png)

???

An ecological community is a set of interacting species which utilize the same environment.

# What is an ecological community?

Community – an association of .blue[interacting] species inhabiting a defined area whose interactions can be + or - & direct or indirect.

# Community Ecology

## Major focus

.font200[
- How are groupings of species distributed in nature? (e.g., diversity)

- How are these groupings explained by the environment and the interactions between and among species?

# Calculating Biodiversity

### There are multiple ways to calculate biodiversity:

.font200[
- Species diversity
- Genetic diversity
- Ecosystem diversity
]

---

# Species diversity

.font200[alpha, beta, and gamma diversity]

![:scale 88%](figs/alpha_beta.png)

---

# Measuring alpha species diversity

.font150[One of the most common measurement is .blue[species richness], the number of species in a community]

![](figs/comm_ab.png)

.font150[.red[What is the species richness for both communities?]]

---

# Species Richness

.font200[
Impossible to count all species

.red[Need to estimate based on sampling (quadrats, plots, transects, traps, etc.)]

Richness depends on number of samples	collected

.red[More samples → more species]

Use extrapolation to predict richness

- Want to predict the asymptote
- Try to collect as few samples as possible
]

???

- with a few samples, you collect mostly common species
- with more samples, you start to collect some of the rarer species
- only with intensive sampling do you start to collect all species
- unless you’ve sampled enough to reach this plateau, beyond which no new species are added, you will miss species
- biological inventories conducted by Nature Conservancy and others rely on extrapolation
- try to predict the asymptote. Also try to collect as few samples as possible to achieve that asymptote
