Even though I have separate sections on Competition and Predation in the course, I don't have one on Mutualism. Mutualism is important ecologically, but often each mutualism is important for a different reason. Mutualisms are often very specific for the types of organisms that are involved. .cyan[Because mutualism is caused by co-evolution, a lot of them have their own idiosyncrasies that don't generalize easily to a way of explaining the overall things that are common to mutualisms]. This is a contrast to Competition and Predation where there are a lot of features common to the interactions between very different pairs of species.

# What is an ecological community?

Community – collection of species that occur at the same place & time, circumscribed by natural (e.g., serpentine soil), arbitrary, or artificial (e.g., 1-m2 quadrat) boundaries


![:scale 85%](figs/community.png)

???

An ecological community is a set of interacting species which utilize the same environment.

# What is an ecological community?

Community – an association of .blue[interacting] species inhabiting a defined area whose interactions can be + or - & direct or indirect.

# Community Ecology

## Major focus

.font200[
- How are groupings of species distributed in nature? (e.g., diversity)

- How are these groupings explained by the environment and the interactions between and among species?

# Biodiversity

# Calculating Biodiversity

### There are multiple ways to calculate biodiversity:

.font200[
- Species diversity
- Genetic diversity
- Ecosystem diversity
]

# Species diversity

.font200[alpha, beta, and gamma diversity]

![:scale 88%](figs/alpha_beta.png)

---

# Measuring alpha species diversity

.font150[One of the most common measurement is .blue[species richness], the number of species in a community]

![](figs/comm_ab.png)

.font150[.red[What is the species richness for both communities?]]

---

# Species Richness

.font200[
Impossible to count all species

.red[Need to estimate based on sampling (quadrats, plots, transects, traps, etc.)]

Richness depends on number of samples	collected

.red[More samples → more species]

.font150[
Use extrapolation to predict richness

- Want to predict the asymptote
- Try to collect as few samples as possible
]

???

- with a few samples, you collect mostly common species
- with more samples, you start to collect some of the rarer species
- only with intensive sampling do you start to collect all species
- unless you’ve sampled enough to reach this plateau, beyond which no new species are added, you will miss species
- biological inventories conducted by Nature Conservancy and others rely on extrapolation
- try to predict the asymptote. Also try to collect as few samples as possible to achieve that asymptote

# Rarefaction

Procedures of individual-based rarefaction

]

.center[![:scale 70%](figs/rarefaction.png)]

# Rarefaction Assumptions

.font200[
+  underlying community is constant over time (no immigration or emigration of species)

+  well-mixed community (spatial distribution of each species is random)

+  individuals are sampled at random (brighter colored individuals aren't sampled more often than others)

+ sampling with identical methods (if used to compare two communities)
]

# Approximation

.font200[

$$E(S_{m}) \approx S - \sum_{i=1}^{S}(1-p_{i})^{m}$$

where $S$ is the number of species, $m$ is the total number of individuals in the sample, and $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$ in the original sample.

What is the Shannon Index of Diversity for the following community?  
A. 0  
B. 1  
C. 2.83  
D. 17

Prop = 1, and ln1 = 0. Therefore, it’s 0.

# Shannon Index

.font200[
Weakness

- Can’t tell if differences in measurements are due to richness or evenness (or can you?)

- Difference between 0.58 & 1.39. What does it mean?

When all species are equally abundant: $H' = \ln (4) = 1.39$: Community B has max diversity

Evenness E = H'/H'max
