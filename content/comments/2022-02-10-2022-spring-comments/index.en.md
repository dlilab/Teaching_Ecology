## More examples for equations

- I would like if we did more examples of test like questions in class.
- I have struggled to understand some of the readings, but mostly, I understand the lecture content. I also have had some trouble understanding certain parts of the lectures. I think a great way to help is to provide sample questions or practice problems to get us used to using the formulas and understanding the concepts and applying them to actual questions. This would help me learn much better compared to just reading notes and articles. I am struggling to apply some of these formulas correctly since we didn't practice the use of them in class. I am especially confused with how to incorporate the multiple time steps/generations for these questions. 
- Personally, I have been struggling when looking back at the models and tables in the lectures. They can be quite complicated to read so additional breakdown of those tables may help.
- My major roadblocks for this course are correlating the equations to the content. You can help by providing better examples.
- Remembering how to apply the equations to the physical words and information we are given in our notes. More explanation around connecting text/ideas to equations.
- A major road block for this course would be that it is online and I am not sure how to prepare for this class. Not knowing exactly how to do these statistical problems also is a major thing that I would say is hard. If we go over how to solve these problems - before the exam I believe that I would be prepared for the exam way better.
- I would love to have a couple of practice exams and sets of examples to use to study! Other than that, it's been great so far.
- I think a major roadblock for me in this course is learning how to use the equations efficiently, more practice problems could help with this.
- It would be very helpful to do more examples problems in class so that I can better understand the mathematical concepts.
- so far it has been applying and conceptualizing the growth equations. I am having trouble visualizing how it applies to the real world vs. just in a lab setting. I think it would help to discuss how these equations manifest themselves in reality.
- Knowing when to use the different formulas, and doing things like matrix multiplication. Maybe start giving like practice worksheets so we can practice how we would use these equations on a test or in real life
- Knowing when to use the different formulas, and doing things like matrix multiplication. Maybe start giving like practice worksheets so we can practice how we would use these equations on a test or in real life
- I think one of the major roadblocks is that we have plenty of equations to learn, but few practice problems with solutions. I believe that offering more practice problems and their solutions would help.
- We haven't had any homeworks or anything similar before taking the exam. It would have been nice to have examples concerning the equations we were given.
- There are no major roadblocks with this course so far, only that I need to get used to studying this topic of material. Only thing I would ask for as help would be more examples; examples make these concepts much more digestible and easy to grasp. 
- My personal major roadblock so far this course has been determining how to record notes during lecture and also understanding and applying the equations to problems like in the test. I believe i could benefit from practice problems using the equations. However, for the most part i have very much enjoyed the class thus far. 
- I think a major roadblock for this course so far is using the equations. I think it would be helpful to have more example questions that would be kind of similar to what would be seen on an exam.
- My major roadblock for this course is making sure I know the equations and understand them. I think working out a few more practice problems and seeing different examples will help me.
- I am struggling with the deeper understandings of the equations. It would help if we did more in class examples working through the math of the equations and why we are choosing that specific one.
- I think that I am just having trouble with understanding equations and what they truly represent. Of course, I know how to plug in the numbers, but I want to be able to understand what the answer is telling me about the population. 
- I found that I had the most difficulty in understanding how to apply the equations we learned. This just requires more practice on my part. R was also pretty difficult to follow and understand. I think more examples with the graphs would help. 
- more examples for questions involving equations, it is hard to apply them to real problems when we haven't worked with them; 

## Powerpoint

- I personally learn best studying off of structured powerpoints. I find the class notes to be confusing and hard to follow.
- The time and length! I have a hard time waking up and staying awake for this course. I preferred the PowerPoint slides method of learning way more than the notes posted on the website. I get overwhelmed seeing the notes altogether, and I freak out when it comes to studying.
- posting the lectures as PowerPoints, I know you mentioned it is tedious but it makes it easier to take notes as you go along. 

## Study guide

- Mostly has been great. For this exam I don't think it was very clear on what topics to focus on but the cheat sheet was very helpful.
- Some major roadblocks in this course is that I do not understand what exactly I need to be studying to get a good grade on test. Some of the questions on this test equations confused me. Other than that I seem to be doing fine hopefully.
- It's difficult to distinguish what information is important and what information isn't. A review day or a list of important topics for each test would be extremely helpful.
- For this course I think my major roadblocks are that I do not know how to prepare for the tests, and that I sometimes do not understand the specific points that the equations are trying to make. I think it would help if there was more in depth explanations of the equations.
- Learning how to study and what to focus most on
- Major road block has been this is all new material that I have never learned and it has been a road block figuring out how to study for this class. 
- Just the amount of information can be a bit foreboding at times, but its nothing a bit of studying can't help.
- I am having trouble trying to condense my studying. For example, I am not quite sure where to start studying because there is so much material so a study guide or outline for future exams would be greatly appreciated. Also, if we had practice problems for the math equations, that would be very useful to help us understand how to work the problems better. 
- There is not anything major I can identify. Perhaps, I have a bias of being too detailed and sometimes I do not know how much attention should be placed on certain things that may not be as important as other topics. This may lead me to look into outside - sources without realizing I should not dig so deep outside the classroom teachings. In that process, some things may be overlooked. Perhaps, a study guide would be helpful. 
- Overall I am enjoying the course so far. My only difficulty is being able to pick out information that is important from the articles and readings. A simple study guide would really help me prepare. It could be something as simple as a list of topics that we should make sure to know and maybe some practice problems. Thanks!

## Coding and graphs

- I think my major roadblock for this course are the graphs and coding. You can help my making it a lot easier to understand because they are very confusing to me. It'd help much to give me a better understanding.

## No roadblock

- I have not encountered any major roadblocks or any real roadblocks at all in this class so far.
- I've been following along with the lectures quite well. It is sometimes just the first wave of exams for the semester is nerve wracking for students. I really enjoy the recordings of the lectures so that I can pause and take more diligent notes when needed.
- I have not had any major roadblocks so far.
- I have not had any major roadblocks regarding the course so far that can be helped by anyone but myself. I really need to spend more time trying to understand the material in this class. I need to emphasize the meaning of the equations not just how to use them.
- So far, I have really enjoyed the course. I haven't been feeling great but besides that I don't really have any issues, besides keeping up with all the equations. 
- I haven't had any major roadblocks in the course yet. I think this test has been very challenging. I have had to use some time into organizing my notes and the methods of teaching styles introduced, but overall I have enjoyed the course so far. 

## Virtual lectures

- One major roadblock in the course has been that it is in an online format currently. I have trouble paying attention while in the comfort of my home and this will be fixed once we return to classroom instruction.
- I think being on zoom had been a major roadblock in terms of class. it is hard to pay attention on zoom.  I think being in person will help students learn better and retain information. In person will also allow more class feedback versus zoom in my opinion. 
- The biggest road block is being completely online. I lack the normal focus compared to sitting in a classroom being able to interact with my peers and professors. I really liked when we did break out rooms to discuss a question. Also there was a lack - communication in expectation for this course especially preparing for the exam. Maybe practice problems and overall class interaction can help facilitate skills to succeed in this class. 
- I do not have a major roadblock that has yet effected me in this class. I enjoy the online formatting of the course and would prefer to attend class via Zoom. This allows my daily schedule to be much more flexible and fit in extra work/study hours. 

## Misc.

- My major road block is that I have two other exams every week I have an exam in this course.
- Finding the time to really study the material as well as truly understanding brand new materal. I am also taking the ecology lab so I do have to worry about that as well. The material itself is really interesting, but whenever equation come into play, it - tends to get a little difficult for me.
- There seems to be a lot of math and material and I need to put more time into the coursework between classes to better understand the information.
- My major roadblocks have been paying good attention in class. Most of what I learned from this test has been from reading the chapter outside of class. There is not necessarily anything you can do, this just tends to happen for me for 1.5 hour classes. 
- My major roadblock for this course would be time management in getting all the readings done and coming back to the topics that leave me uncertain. This course is impacted by a lot of information. Overall, I think how organized and the use of Dr. Li's - website makes this course easier to adjust than other courses. 
- Digesting the dense readings. I should visit office hours with my questions.
- Being apple to apply the information given, like in equations and graph interpretations.
- I enjoy the format of this class. I need help better understanding the pictures i am looking at and possibly working some of the math problems in class.
- Memorize the different features of different biomes
- my major roadblocks for this course is maybe the equations and tying them into the actual understanding of the work. i know when and how to use the equations i just don't really now what the answers mean when i get them, if that makes sense. also should we be taking notes from the book as well?
- I dont think i have any major road blocks, its mostly just the math im struggling with so far and all the equations to remember. There is so much more to the environment then i thought. 
- The only major roadblock that I can think of for this course is finding a group for the final project
- Throughout this course roadblocks that’s I’ve began to experience would be mixing up small little equations with other equations from previous classes. I know I’ll definitely have to study a little harder in order to overcome this roadblock though.
- The hardest part of this class for me right now is taking notes at an appropriate pace during lectures, but I believe I have a better handle on it now.
